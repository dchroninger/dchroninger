Welcome! I'm Dave. I'm a husband, software engineer, leader, and learner. After years of "I'll get to it after the next project", I decided to finally just ship something and get this going. This blog is going to be a collection of my thoughts on software, my journey through learning Japanese, travel, and my hobbies. You can think of this as the place anyone can go to learn about me or get in touch to collaborate. First and foremost it's my place to document my thoughts and my growth.

## Getting to the "Just ship it" mentality

For years, I found myself stuck in a cycle of perfectionism—waiting for the “right” framework, the perfect design, or the ideal moment when life wasn’t so busy. I had countless ideas for a personal website and blog, but each one was held back by an unrealistic standard of perfection that never truly arrives. The reality I learned as a software engineer is that perfection often becomes the biggest barrier to actually delivering anything. Instead of releasing something tangible, I spent too long refining imaginary details, always promising myself I’d finally ship “next month” or “after this next milestone.”

Adopting a “ship it first” mentality was transformative. I realized that shipping imperfect work today and iterating tomorrow is far more productive—and satisfying—than holding off indefinitely for a flawless product. By embracing this mindset, I finally broke free from procrastination disguised as meticulous preparation. My blog is live now, not because it’s perfect, but precisely because it’s good enough to serve as a foundation. Every feature, post, and design tweak can be iteratively improved over time, which aligns perfectly with the agile principles that resonate with me professionally.

This shift wasn’t just about launching a blog; it was about cultivating a healthier, more pragmatic relationship with my work. As developers, it’s easy to forget that the core purpose of building is to create and share. Perfection is an ever-moving target, but shipping is immediate and actionable. I’m excited to start sharing insights, experiences, and even imperfections through this blog—because done truly is better than perfect.

## What's Next?

The next steps here are to add a few more sections about myself, what I do, and what I've done.

I'm thinking that the next feature will be the introduction of my car hobby and going over those builds. Once I get that put together I'll make sure to put an update here.
