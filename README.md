# Hey there, I’m Dave! 👋

_"From console logs to concept cars—turning passion into new creations."_

## Introduction

I’m a self-taught software engineer with **6+ years of experience** who loves blending tech with my personal passions—be it **working on cars**, **learning Japanese**, or tinkering with **new programming languages**. Currently, I’m diving deeper into **Golang** while dabbling in **Elixir**, and I’m excited about the fresh perspectives both bring to building efficient, user-centric applications.

By day, I’m an **IT Engineering Manager** who mentors a small but mighty team, designs IT infrastructure, and codes internal tools. My role gives me a unique blend of technical, operational, and leadership responsibilities—which I enjoy just as much as rolling up my sleeves to build something from scratch.

## Skills & Tech

- **Primary Languages**:

  - **TypeScript** for modern web frontends and quick scripts
  - **Golang** for backend APIs (currently deepening my expertise)
  - **PowerShell** for system scripting
  - **SQL** for database design and querying (most experienced in Microsoft SQL Server)

- **Secondary Languages**:

  - **Rust** because shouldn't we all rewrite everything in Rust?
  - **C#** for ease of integration with on-premises Active Directory
  - **CFML** for a legacy codebase I inherited

- **Frameworks, Libraries & Tools**:

  - Regularly working with **React**, **GoFiber**, and **TailwindCSS**
  - Formerly used **Express.js**,**Next.js**, **MUI**, **Redux**, and **Prisma** but now leaning towards Context-based state management and direct SQL
  - Experimenting with **TanStack** libraries and expanding my **GoFiber** skills

- **Databases & ETL**:
  - Deep experience with **Microsoft SQL Server** (including **SSIS** ETL pipelines)
  - Some past experience with **MongoDB**

## Projects & Focus

- **CAN-bus Exploration** – Tapping into automotive systems and eventually building a custom **infotainment system** for my cars
- **Printer Management App** – A practical solution for a daily workflow challenge
- **[Dotfiles](https://github.com/dchroninger/.dotfiles)** – Because I’m a big fan of refining workflows and sharing tips for a better dev environment

> _I’m always open to new ideas—if you’ve got something interesting to collaborate on, let’s chat!_

## Workflow & Tools

- **Editor & Terminal**: [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) + tmux
- **CLI for Git**: Because sometimes, simplicity reigns supreme
- **Productivity Setup**:
  - **yabai**, **skhd** for window management
  - **Alfred**, **Focus**, **kitty**, **Karabiner Elements** to streamline my daily tasks
- **Hardware**:
  - M1 Max MacBook Pro
  - [Zsa Voyager](https://shop.zsa.io/) keyboard (Kaihl brown switches)
  - Logitech MX Master 3 mouse

I’m most comfortable in POSIX-compliant environments, but can adapt to just about any setup if needed.

## Hobbies & Life Outside Code

Outside of coding, you’ll likely find me:

- **Under the hood** of my **widebody Genesis Coupe** or my **1993 Y32 Nissan Gloria**
- **Studying Japanese**—pursuing a language degree while also working on my Computer Science transfer
- Brainstorming how to merge these interests (coding + cars = custom infotainment system, right?)
